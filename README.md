# 💖 Barbie-Themed Expense Tracker

This is a beginner-friendly React Native app I built using **Expo**, **Clerk**, and **Neon**. While it's a common idea (expense tracker), the goal was to learn and implement real-world features like:

- 📱 Cross-platform mobile UI with React Native (Expo)
- 🔐 Email-based login/signup with Clerk (handled rate limit errors too!)
- 🗂️ Cloud database setup using Neon (PostgreSQL)

## ✨ Features
- Email signup/login with verification
- Add and save income/expense transactions
- View recent transactions on the homepage
- Barbie-themed UI 🎀 (tech should be fun!)

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- React Native (Expo)
- Clerk for authentication
- Neon for database

## 📚 Learning Outcome
This was my first step into React Native and mobile app development. I wanted to blend creative UI with real functionality to grow my frontend + backend skills.
